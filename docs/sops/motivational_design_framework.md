### 1.0 Core Principles: Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

This framework is grounded in Self-Determination Theory, a psychological model that distinguishes between two core types of motivation. Our strategy is to use both to guide users from initial trial to long-term, habitual use.

* **1.1 Extrinsic Motivation:** This refers to performing an activity to attain a separable outcome, such as earning a reward or avoiding a punishment. The motivation comes from outside the individual. We use extrinsic motivators as a temporary "scaffold" to drive initial user activation by making the first interaction as rewarding and low-risk as possible.

* **1.2 Intrinsic Motivation:** This refers to doing an activity for its inherent satisfaction and the enjoyment of the experience itself. This motivation flourishes when it satisfies the core psychological needs for **Autonomy** (sense of choice), **Competence** (sense of mastery), and **Relatedness** (sense of connection). Our features are designed to cultivate this, forming the lasting structure of habit.

* **1.3 Strategic Goal (Internalization):** The primary goal is to help users internalize the value of the behaviour, moving them along the spectrum from being motivated by external rewards toward a state where the action is self-endorsed and becomes part of their identity. This process of internalization is the key to transforming a fragile, reward-dependent behaviour into a resilient, self-determined habit.

### 2.0 Extrinsic Scaffolding (User Activation)

The following features are designed to provide powerful external incentives that encourage a developer to try the service for the first time. Their purpose is to remove friction and demonstrate immediate value, activating the user.

* **2.1 The Frictionless Free Trial:**
    * **Description:** For the launch month, users receive their first 10 background removals completely free. No sign-up or credit card is required.
    * **Motivational Purpose:** This is the most critical extrinsic motivator. It removes all risk and commitment barriers, allowing a new user to fully experience the "magic moment" of the core service and validate its usefulness for their own projects.

* **2.2 "Try a Sample" One-Click Demo:**
    * **Description:** The landing page features 2-3 pre-selected sample character images alongside the main upload area. A single click on a sample instantly runs it through the full removal process.
    * **Motivational Purpose:** This activates users who may be curious but do not have an image ready to upload. It immediately demonstrates the app's speed and quality with zero effort required from the user.

### 3.0 Intrinsic Core (Long-Term Retention)

The following features are designed to make the core experience of using the application itself so efficient, satisfying, and enjoyable that they become their own reward. Their purpose is to build long-term, sustainable engagement by fostering feelings of mastery and delight.

* **3.1 The "Flow State" Workflow:**
    * **Description:** The user experience is built for pure, uninterrupted speed. The workflow combines keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+V), instant processing, and a hyper-minimalist UI.
    * **Motivational Purpose:** This feature provides the intrinsic reward of mastery and efficiency. The user never breaks their creative concentration, making the tool feel like a seamless extension of their mind. This feeling is a powerful driver for making the product a go-to utility.

* **3.2 Delightful Micro-interactions:**
    * **Description:** The background removal process is visualized as a "Magic Workbench" where the background visually "dissolves" with a satisfying animation.
    * **Motivational Purpose:** This interaction provides a small, reliable dopamine hit that transforms a mundane chore into an enjoyable moment. The feeling of aesthetic pleasure and "magic" makes the user feel good about the process, intrinsically motivating them to return over more sterile or clunky alternatives.
