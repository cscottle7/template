### 11. Agentic Workflow Rules
This project operates under a strict agentic workflow known as the **Plan-Then-Execute Doctrine**. All complex development tasks must follow this multi-step process:
1.  **Planning:** Invoke the `plan_creator` agent to generate a detailed proposal.
2.  **Human Approval:** A human developer MUST review and approve the plan.
3.  **Execution:** The `dev_implement` agent writes the code strictly adhering to the approved plan.
4.  **Review:** All new code MUST be reviewed by the `review_code` agent before being committed.


### 12. Prohibitions (Forbidden Actions)
* **DO NOT** [e.g., commit code directly to the main branch.]
* **DO NOT** [e.g., use the `requests` library; you must use `httpx`.]
* **DO NOT** [e.g., add new dependencies without updating this constitution.]

### 13. Core Definitions & Glossary
* **[Term 1]:** [Definition]
* **[Term 2]:** [Definition]

### 14. Development Plan (`task_deps.md`)
*[Placeholder: This section will be populated with a link to the `task_deps.md` file once the high-level action plan has been decomposed into granular tasks.]*
